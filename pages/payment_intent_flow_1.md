## Payment Intents API

Use the Payment Intents API to build an integration that can handle complex payment flows with a status that changes over the PaymentIntentâ€™s lifecycle. It tracks a payment from creation through checkout, and triggers additional authentication steps when required.

- Automatic authentication handling

- Support for Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) and similar regulatory changes

- Use the Payment Intents API together with the Setup Intents and Payment Methods APIs. These APIs help you handle dynamic payments (for example, additional authentication like 3D Secure) and prepare you for expansion to other countries while allowing you to support new regulations and regional payment methods.
