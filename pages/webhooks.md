## Webhooks

A webhook is an HTTP endpoint that receives events from Stripe.

Webhooks allow you to be notified about payment events that happen in the real world outside of your payment flow such as:

- Successful payments (payment_intent.succeeded)

- Disputed payments (charge.dispute.created)

- Available balance in your Stripe account (balance.available)
